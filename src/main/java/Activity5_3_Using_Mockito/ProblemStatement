USING MOCKITO
------------------
Consider a scenario where you are working on a module of a shopping application.

In this application you have created the
 ???>>>ShoppingItem class (Model Class) to represent an item
that can be shopped.

In addition, you have created the
???>>>MyShoppingCart class that --- helps adding items to the shopping cart
during shopping.

This class contains a
method to calculate the total price of the items added to the cart.

The method that calculate the total price of items added to the cart calls the
>>> getPrice()
method of the MyStore service by passing the name of each item. Now, you have
to test all the functionality of the methods iin the MyShoppingCart class.
However, you do not have access to MyStore service. Therefore, you have to mock
the behaviour of the getPrice() method of this service to test the functionality
of the methods available in the MyShoppingCart class.

How will you accomplish the preceding task by using the Mockito Framework???
